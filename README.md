# Trick-to-Calculate-Probability-using-simulation
Statistical analysis requires clear cut understanding of probabilities. So I am creating this small piece.


###  You roll five six-sided dice. Write a script in R to calculate the probability of getting between 15 and 20 (inclusive) as the total amount of your roll (ie, the sum when you add up what is showing on all five dice). Exact solutions are preferable but approximate solutions are ok as long as they are precise.

**We can assume law of large number, when sample size n tends to infinity then static, in our case p of any number between 1 to 6, approaches to its true value. which is 1 by 6.**
